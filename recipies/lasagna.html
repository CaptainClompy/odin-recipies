         <h3>Description:</h3>
         
         <p>This healthy, hearty, amazing lasagna has veggies in it. Can you believe that? What
             a concept! Honestly, I have no idea what to write here, this is just to prove that
             I know how to add paragraphs to a webpage. This is looking pretty good though. I just
             hope I haven't made any mistakes. I ran the code a couple times and it seems like everything
             is in working order, but who knows? This project is actually kind of fun though. Really
             gives me a chance to test my skills and see if I'm really cut out for this sort of
             thing. Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope this was interesting for you in some way.
             Now I will list what this absolute unit of a dish is made of.</p>

         <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

         <ul>
             <li>1 (16oz) package lasagna noodles</li>
             <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
             <li>3/4 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
             <li>3/4 cup chopped onion</li>
             <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
             <li>2 (26oz) jars pasta sauce</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
             <li>1 (15oz) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
             <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
             <li>2 eggs</li>
             <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Steps:</h3>
         
         <ol>
             <li>Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
             <li>In a large saucepan, cook and stir mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic in oil. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
             <li>Mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs.</li>
             <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 1 cup tomato sauce into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 each, lasagna noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering, and top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella cheese.</li>
             <li>Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
         </ol>
